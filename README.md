# SpaceBlob
A metroidvania (technically platformer?) being created for a hackclub event . You were chillimg in space because you are the cool space blob, Blobby, and suddenly, the atmosphere pulls you down to this strange planet called terra. As you fall, your slime parts break up and fall into other areas of terra. You need to find your slime parts and get back to space!
